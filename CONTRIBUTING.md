Contributing
============

Thanks for helping out!

## Development

Run `builder run open-hot` or `builder run open-dev` to run a webpack dev server
with component examples.

## Checks, Tests

Run `builder run check` before committing.

## Dist

Please do not commit changes to files in `dist`.
These files are only committed when we tag releases.

## Generator Compatibility

All boilerplate components should be named
`victory-component-boilerplate` or
`VictoryComponentBoilerplate` as appropriate.

`src/components/victory-component-boilerplate.jsx` and
`test/client/spec/components/victory-component-boilerplate.spec.jsx`
SHOULD NOT be moved or renamed
